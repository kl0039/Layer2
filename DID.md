## Project Abstract

The project aims to develop a layer 2 solution for digital identity management in the Metaverse. The proposed solution will build upon existing Ethereum standards and utilize a novel approach to address the unique challenges posed by the Metaverse.

## Objectives

- To create a secure and decentralized layer 2 solution for managing digital identities in the Metaverse.
- To enhance user privacy and control over personal data in the Metaverse.
- To establish a new standard for identity management in the Metaverse ecosystem.

## Outcomes

This project aims to create a new layer 2 solution to address the issue of digital identity in the Metaverse, which is an emerging and rapidly growing field in the Ethereum ecosystem. By providing a secure and decentralized digital identity solution, the project will enable users to interact with Metaverse assets and services with greater trust and security. This will ultimately help to build a stronger and more robust Ethereum ecosystem by promoting the use and adoption of decentralized applications and services.

Additionally, the project's research findings and technical developments may also contribute to the broader Ethereum community by advancing the knowledge and understanding of layer 2 solutions and their potential applications. The project team also plans to share their research findings and technical developments with the community through publications and presentations at relevant conferences and events. This will enable other developers and researchers in the Ethereum ecosystem to build upon the project's work and contribute to the continued growth and development of the ecosystem.

- A functional layer 2 solution for managing digital identities in the Metaverse, tested and ready for deployment.
- A new standard for identity management in the Metaverse ecosystem, recognized and adopted by industry stakeholders.
- Increased awareness and understanding of the importance of digital identity management in the Metaverse.

## Grant Scope

The grant scope for this research project exploring the use of a new layer 2 solution for metaverse identity might include activities such as developing and testing the new solution, conducting user studies and surveys to evaluate its effectiveness and usability, and publishing papers or reports documenting the research findings and the new solution.

The expected output of the project would be a new layer 2 solution that addresses the challenges of digital identity in the metaverse, along with research findings and insights that contribute to the broader field of blockchain and identity research. The specific outputs might include a working software prototype, academic publications, and community engagement activities such as conferences, workshops, and online forums.

## Project Team

The project team will consist of experienced blockchain developers and researchers, as well as experts in identity management and Metaverse technologies. The team will be led by a project manager who will oversee the development and implementation of the solution.

Each team member will work an average of 160 hours per month on this project, focusing on the development, testing, and deployment of the new layer 2 solution for Metaverse digital identities. The team members will work closely with each other and with the grant manager to ensure that the project stays on track and meets all milestones and deliverables within the proposed timeline

## Methodology

- Literature review: We will conduct a thorough literature review to gather information about existing layer 2 solutions and their applicability to the metaverse identity problem.
- Develop a proof of concept: We will develop a proof of concept to test the feasibility of using a layer 2 solution to address the metaverse identity problem. This will involve developing a smart contract and integrating it with the layer 2 solution.
- Testing and evaluation: We will conduct extensive testing and evaluation of the proof of concept to determine its effectiveness in addressing the metaverse identity problem. We will also gather feedback from users and incorporate it into the design.
- Refinement and optimization: Based on the results of testing and evaluation, we will refine and optimize the proof of concept to improve its performance and functionality.
- Documentation and dissemination: We will document the findings of our research and disseminate them through academic publications and open-source repositories.

## Timeline

The objectives of this project are to:

- Develop a layer 2 solution for managing digital identities in the metaverse.
- Test the performance and scalability of the solution.
- Promote the adoption of the solution among metaverse developers and users.
